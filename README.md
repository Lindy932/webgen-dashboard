# 📊  TCIA Cancer Imaging Dashboard

An interactive Python-Dash web application that queries and visualizes metadata from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) to empower cancer researchers and medical analysts. Built to enhance data accessibility, this tool allows users to filter and compare over 50,000 imaging records across cancer types, imaging modalities, patient demographics and diagnoses. It is intended to support smarter, faster decision-making through dynamic and insightful visualizations.

## 🚀 Project Summary
The dashboard connects raw imaging metadata to user-friendly visual insights by:
- Using REST API integration to enable real time querying of TCIA database study level metadata
- Allowing users to filter and compare imaging records by diagnosis, cancer type, modality, and study date
- Provide interactive data visualizations

## 🎯 Key Features
- Interactive Filtering
- Restful public API integration
- Responsive Dash UIs
- 50,000+ Records (high volume reseaarch grade datasets)
